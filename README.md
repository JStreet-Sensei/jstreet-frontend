## Folder structure
There is two ways in Nextjs for routing. We adopt pages routing, not app routing. <br>

Folder structure is related to routing.<br>
https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing

Folder structure convention. See page router section.<br>
https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure

The basic behavior of Next.js by naming for file/folders.<br>
 There are some part which is defferent in between page router and app router.<br>
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation<br>

The _app.tsx file is used for rendering every page.<br>
https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app

Page name is case-sensitive. URL is case-sensitive as well.

* Commponents<br>
React components used in each page. For example, flash card, card to show score, ...<br>
The name should be camel case.

* Pages<br>
These represents pages.<br>

* apis<br>

## Commands

* install<br>
npm install<br>
â€»For development of only frontend, we don't need docker run.<br>

* run local<br>
npm run dev<br>

## Route
### Protected route
Use middleware.ts for protected route.

## Authentication
We use Nextauth.js.
Detail logic.

## Errors
* App doesn't run after successful build.
Make sure you use the latest things. Delete your image, container, and volume. Run docker compose commands again.

### Reference
Using google auth.<br>

# This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
